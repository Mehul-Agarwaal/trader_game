# trader_game
so this  repository contains  c++ code regarding a basic trading game where a trader travels between villages and trade goods in exchange for gold.

so this is week 1's progress, the game has taken its basic shape.
goal for upcoming weeks is to improve game, at present the day ends when the trader leaves one village, I hope to add a  timer for example 10 mins after which the day will end and the player can travel n number of villages within the time limit.
